# Face_Authentication_Attendence_System
This project is a Face Authentication Attendance System built using Python. It uses a camera to register and recognize faces in real time and marks attendance as punch-in and punch-out. The system works with live camera input, handles different lighting conditions, and includes basic spoof prevention.
